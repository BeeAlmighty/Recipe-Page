## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt how to style list markers with a CSS property called 'li::marker'. 
- I really got in touch with responsive web design by making sure my project was accessible from small screens like 320px to larger screens like 1440px.

### Continued development

- I want to get tested with responsive web design more often and want to really integrate mobile-first workflow.
- I want to work on adding functionality to my projects with the help of javascript and other framework.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - The authority when it comes to asking for help with coding problems. Stack overflow helped me with how to style my ordered list numbers.
